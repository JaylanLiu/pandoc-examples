{\Large Exhibit B}
\end{center}

The software provided by the Contractor, delivering the *game engine*,
needs to fulfil the following requirements and tests.

### Requirements for Game Engine:

1. The game engine needs to provide the following API:
     * `giveNextMove(*args, **kwargs)`: this function receives the board as a
     matrix, i.e. `[[0, X, O],[O, X, O], [X, 7, 8]]`, where the `X` and `O`
     represent the pieces in the board, and a `String` with symbol `X` or `O`
     to indicate that the AI needs to play for `X`. The AI returns a list with
     the same format and a new `X` in one of the available spaces.
     * `AIvsAI()`, which receives no arguments and returns a list of lists
     containing the movements of `X` and `O` in each turn, e.g.


            [[X, 1], [O, 0], [X, 4], [O, 2], [X, 7]]


     * `setDifficulty(int)`, where I can set the difficulty of the AI and change
     as I wish during the game.

2. Tests:
    * If I pass a finished game state to the AI, the AI must reply with an empty list.
    * The set difficulty can be set to 0, 1 or 2. Setting the difficulty to any
    other value sets the difficulty to 1 by default.
    * In a tournament, and after setting the AI to level 2, I want the AI to
    reduce its difficulty linearly every two draws of the same players, given
    that in my tournament a draw means a rematch.

3. Payment conditions
    * If the requirements are not met, the Contractor will pay back *5 Uppsalines* per missing requirement.
    * If a test is not satisfied, we provide the code to the Contractor and the
    Contractor has 24h from the moment the email has been sent to fix the error.
